Setup instruction (in Chinese):https://hollyqood.wordpress.com/2015/12/01/ros-slam-2-hector-slam-2d%E5%9C%B0%E5%9C%96%E5%BB%BA%E7%BD%AE/
The setup procedure is followed by the Chinese instruction:

Google-Cartographer launch file build (in Chinese): http://blog.csdn.net/ywj447/article/details/52922487

Since Google changed some of their codes in Cartographer, some part of the launch file build instructions are incorrect, but most of them are correct. The modified launch files are included in the git.
